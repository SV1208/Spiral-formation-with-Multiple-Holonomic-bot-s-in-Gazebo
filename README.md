# Spiral Formation with Multiple Holonomic Bots in Gazebo

This project demonstrates a **multi-robot holonomic control system** in a Gazebo simulation using ROS 2. Four holonomic mobile robots are launched in a circle and are controlled to **spiral inward and then outward** in a coordinated formation. It showcases the loading and control of multiple robots simultaneously, highlighting the ability to manage and command their movements.

## üí° Project Highlights

- **Multi-robot Holonomic Motion Control:** Demonstrates coordinated control of four holonomic robots.
- **Spiral Formation:** Robots  spiral inward towards a center point and then expand outward in a circular formation.
- **Simultaneous Loading and Control:** Shows the process of loading multiple robot models in Gazebo and controlling them concurrently.
- **ROS 2 Implementation:** Utilizes ROS 2 for robot control and communication.

My part was to launch multiple bots and make the spiral node
